#Edinburgh Clojurians Meetup & Communications Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the events. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.  This also applies to online communication, including the group's [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/edinburgh-clojurians) and [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-Clojurians/) forums.

###Need Help?

You can contact the group organisers via [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-Clojurians/) or clojure@koshatnik.com

##The Quick Version

Our Clojure community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of group participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any group activity, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Group participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group online and offline without a refund (where admission fees are applicable) at the discretion of the group organisers.

We want this group to be an encouraging environment for anyone who wishes to learn Clojure.  For this reason, behaviour which might be offputting for beginners (e.g. being dismissive of another participant's level of knowledge or offering unsolicited negative criticism) is strongly discouraged, and repeat offenders may be asked to leave. 

##The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organiser immediately.

Event  volunteers will be happy to help participants contact local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
